    "# Market Analsis and New Product Recomedation for Digital Media Market using Deloitte Digital Democracy Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Executive Summary\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to identify specifications for a new product that could be created in order to ensure a good market fit. Based on the information from the following data analysis we found that the most interesting market to move into could be mobile sports streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem\n",
    "With an overwhelming amount of information on consumer habits and a very congested streaming market, it might be difficult to determine specific markets to which we can advertise the product. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "We explore customer habits to see how to cluster them into potential customer groups and explore what are the potential ways to break into the market by observing the trends over the years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Overview\n",
    "Deloitte Digital Democracy Survey results which we used for years 2009-2011 contained answers to approximately 190 questions for over 2000 respondents each year. A lot of the columns contain a lot of messy information that needs to be first cleaned in order to reach meaningful conclusions. For this project, we specifically focused on survey data on consumer demographics, current device usage, current mobile phone app usage and media consumption pattern responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling Preparation\n",
    "We first prepare the data by changing survey responses to numerical answers and then group the information to help aggregate responses by different demographic groups. We ensure that there are no missing values and that the columns are meaningful and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling Approach\n",
    "We cluster survey respondents using the K-means algorithm and evaluate the clusters using silhouette scores. For time-series analysis, due to the lack of granularity in our data, we explore simple changes over time, such as average year-over-year changes in device usage and media consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results \n",
    "We found a number of interesting correlations in terms of changing app usage and the groups that are using them. We discover that one area that might provide a lot of untapped potential is mobile sports streaming, which seems to be growing dramatically and caters to a relatively narrow, but passionate higher-income consumer groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Result Evaluation\n",
    "We evaluate our clustering results based on the silhoutte scores and through normalization of scores for the time-series.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Next Steps\n",
    "For our next steps we would like to (A) evaluate and identify better sub-clusters using additional demographic and/or market data, (B) test our prototype through in-depth A/B testing to finalize product features.\n",

    "3. Customer Analysis: Smartphone App Usage\n",
